# metabase-api-rs Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how to use the `metabase-api-rs` library.

## Prerequisites

Before running the examples, ensure you have:

1. A running Metabase instance (local or remote)
2. Valid credentials (email/password or API key)
3. Environment variables configured (optional):

```bash
export METABASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
export METABASE_EMAIL="admin@example.com"
export METABASE_PASSWORD="password123"
```

## Available Examples

### 1. Simple Example (`simple_example.rs`)
The simplest starting point:
- Client creation with ClientBuilder
- Authentication using email/password
- Getting current user information
- Listing collections and cards

```bash
cargo run --example simple_example
```

### 2. Basic Usage (`basic_usage.rs`)
Demonstrates fundamental operations:
- Creating and configuring a client
- Authentication methods
- Getting user details
- Listing collections and cards
- Proper logout

```bash
cargo run --example basic_usage
```

### 3. Query Execution (`query_execution.rs`)
Shows various ways to execute queries:
- Simple SQL queries
- Parameterized SQL queries with type safety
- NativeQuery builder pattern
- MBQL (Metabase Query Language) queries
- Exporting results in different formats (CSV, JSON, XLSX)

```bash
cargo run --example query_execution
# With MBQL feature:
cargo run --example query_execution --features query-builder
```

### 4. CRUD Simple (`crud_simple.rs`)
Simplified CRUD examples for main entities:
- Collections: List and read operations
- Cards (Questions): List, read, and query execution
- Dashboards: List and read operations
- Update operations using JSON

```bash
cargo run --example crud_simple
```

### 5. Advanced Features (`advanced_features.rs`)
Advanced functionality demonstration:
- Cache control and performance optimization
- Custom retry policies for resilience
- Comprehensive error handling patterns
- Session management and auto-refresh
- Performance tuning techniques

```bash
cargo run --example advanced_features
# With cache feature:
cargo run --example advanced_features --features cache
```

## Running Examples

### Run a specific example:
```bash
cargo run --example <example_name>
```

### Run with all features enabled:
```bash
cargo run --example <example_name> --features full
```

### Run with verbose output:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example <example_name>
```

## Docker Setup for Testing

If you need a local Metabase instance for testing:

```bash
# Start Metabase with Docker
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase:latest

# Wait for Metabase to start (takes about 30 seconds)
sleep 30

# Access Metabase at http://localhost:3000
# Complete the setup wizard to create an admin account
```

## Common Issues

### Connection Refused
- Ensure Metabase is running and accessible
- Check the URL in environment variables or code
- Verify firewall/network settings

### Authentication Failed
- Verify credentials are correct
- Ensure the user account is active
- Check if API access is enabled in Metabase

### Missing Features
Some examples require specific features to be enabled:
```bash
# Enable all features
cargo run --example <example_name> --features full

# Enable specific features
cargo run --example <example_name> --features "cache,query-builder"
```

## Example Output
